To use:
All csv files most follow this pattern:
  At1; At2; ...; Atn; class

If attribute contains decimal, it must use a (,) instead of a (.).

Run the main file, DCT_Main, and it will prompt you for the name of the file you want to load.
This file must be located in the main folder with the rest of the supplied csv files.
